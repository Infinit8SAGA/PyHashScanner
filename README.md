# PyHashScanner
\n hi i made a simple hash scanner


\n #intro and everything else:
\n this code will scan and find the imaginary malware it uses hash 
\n for example i made a test.exe and a malware_hash file. the bad hash in malware_hash is in the test.exe too 
\n so if you change the words in test.exe the hash will change too so you should copy the new hash in malware_hash.
\n think like this: 
\n the so called antivirus will check the file hash and then it compare it to the mlaware hashes so if there is any similarity the file can be a malware,
\n so the code will detect the test.exe as a malware.
\n this method is being useed in antivirus programs 
\n i hope you enjoy 
\n im not saying that this code is great of course it has some weaknesses
