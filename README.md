# PyHashScanner
 hi i made a simple hash scanner


 #intro and everything else:
 
 this code will scan and find the imaginary malware it uses hash 
 
 for example i made a test.exe and a malware_hash file in the desktop. the bad hash in malware_hash is in the test.exe too
 
 so if you change the words in test.exe the hash will change too so you should copy the new hash in malware_hash.
 
 think like this: 
 
 the so called antivirus will check the file hash and then it compare it to the mlaware hashes so if there is any similarity the file can be a malware
 so the code will detect the test.exe as a malware.
 
 this method is being useed in antivirus programs 
 
 i hope you enjoy 
 
 im not saying that this code is great of course it has some weaknesses
